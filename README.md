# 3rd Como Training School on Compound Events - Project 1
Welcome everyone! Here's the step-by-step guide of how to install the Python packages required for the project. 
(We recommend using Anaconda for installation. Anaconda can be downloaded and installed from https://www.anaconda.com/download/success)

1. Clone this repository (https://github.com/timo0thy/como) to your local laptop, or download all the files and store within the same folder.
2. Install the environment (recommended using the Anaconda Prompt by running the command `conda env create -f environment.yml`)
3. Activate the environment (recommended using the Anaconda Prompt by running the command `conda activate Tigramite`)
4. Clone the Tigramite repository (https://github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite) to your local laptop
5. Install Tigramite by running the command `python setup.py install` (make sure that you are within the `tigramite` directory)
6. Go back to this repository and try running the example script `PCMCI_test_script.py` by running the command `python PCMCI_test_script.py` - if it produces a PDF file with the causal diagram above, you've got there! well done :) But don't worry if you can't, as that's only needed by the end of our Day 1 at Como.

For steps (1) - (3), you may refer to https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html for more details.
